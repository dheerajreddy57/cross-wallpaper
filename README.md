# cross-wallpaper
A wallpaper changer cross-platform in dart for flutter

## Windows

- use `dart:ffi` and call some `win32.dll` funcs

## Android

- use `launcher_assist` which's already written
- improve if something doesn't work while using it

## TODO

- [ ] Windows
- [ ] Copy Funcs from [go/wallpaper](https://github.com/reujab/wallpaper)
